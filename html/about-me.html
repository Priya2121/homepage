        <P>
            My name is Priyadharshini Chandrakanthan.
            I am student of Concordia University, who moved to Canada three years ago.
            I live here with my sister and her family.
            I am originally from India. I have two sisters and I am a proud auntie of my beautiful niece and lovely
            nephew.
            I did my Bachelor degree in Holy Cross College in India. I basically came here to live with my sister and
            also sharpen my career life. I have been doing my Bachelor degree, majoring in Accounting for the past three
            years. I have a diploma in Human Resources Management. I am currently doing a diploma in Social Media
            Applications and Marketing. I am interested in Developing and Designing. I have been exploring all my
            favourite course of studies not intentionally but I am confident that I will find my passionate work of
            field after completing this diploma.
